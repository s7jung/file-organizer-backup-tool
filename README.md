Simple script for organizing files in a folder by date and extension and backing them up to an external location, and compressing old files into a ZIP archive. (draft 1)

Currently it can back up files to any local or mounted storage path. This includes:
1. External Hard Drives: Any path to a connected external drive (e.g., `D:\Backup` or `/mnt/external_drive`).
2. Network Drives


How to Use:
* Run the script with Python.
* Input the source folder path, backup destination, and the number of days to determine files to be compressed. 
* The script will handle the rest!
